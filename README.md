# Simon Says (Dance Ed.)


This project was based off an electronic game Simon which creates a series of tones and lights.  The series of tones and lights are first played to the player.  The player then needs to correctly repeat the sequence of that was just played.  If the player succeeds, the series become longer and more complex until the player fails or successfully repeats the sequence 8 times.
